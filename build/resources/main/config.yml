# Entity Cleanup Plugin Configuration

# The interval in seconds between entity cleanup tasks.
# Default: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
cleanup-interval-seconds: 300

# The delay in seconds before the first cleanup task runs after plugin starts.
# Default: 60 seconds (1 minute)
# @腐竹，如果你想防止农场的话一般15秒就够了
cleanup-delay-seconds: 60

# List of entity types to clear during cleanup.
# Use the Bukkit EntityType names (e.g., ZOMBIE, SKELETON, SPIDER, DROPPED_ITEM).
# Be cautious with entities like PLAYER, ANIMALS, VILLAGER, etc., as clearing them is usually not desired.
# Personally I don't think paper or spigot will allow this without screwming at you
# An empty list means no entities will be cleared by the scheduled task.
